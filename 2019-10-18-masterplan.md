## „I got Friday on my mind!”

This note is just a starting point for a new kind of publishing. Since my question is "How can I use the services that Github provides for storing my short-term notes and textual snippets?

This note was written by using [prose](https://prose.io).

As always the hardest part is the proper usage of the current date and time.
